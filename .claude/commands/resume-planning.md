Resume planning session for: $ARGUMENTS

Check for existing work:
1. Look for /docs/plans/epic-*.md matching this topic
2. Check /docs/progress.md for notes on where we left off

## If Epic Doc Exists (Partial)
- Read it and identify what sections are complete vs incomplete
- Summarize: "Last time we got through [X], still need [Y]"
- Pick up from where we stopped

## If No Doc Yet
- Check progress.md for any notes on this planning effort
- Restart the planning interview from the beginning

## Resume the Interview
Continue with the plan-epic interview style:
- One question at a time
- Don't rush phases
- Confirm alignment before generating/updating docs

Let me know where we're picking up and what's still needed.
