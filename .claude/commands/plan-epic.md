Help me plan a new epic: $ARGUMENTS

This is an interview-style planning session. Be persistent and thorough. Don't rush. Ask one question at a time and wait for my response. 
Be sure to check existing epics in @roadmap and read details if applliacable we want to avoid duplicate work. 

## Phase 1: Problem & Goals
- What problem are we solving? Why now?
- Who benefits? (users, business, team)
- What does "done" look like?
- What does "done well" look like?

## Phase 2: Scope Definition
- What's definitely IN scope?
- What's explicitly OUT of scope?
- Are there gray areas we need to decide on?
- Dependencies on other epics or external factors?

## Phase 3: Technical Approach
- Any technical constraints or preferences?
- What existing code/systems does this touch?
- Are there multiple approaches? Let's discuss trade-offs.
- What's the riskiest part?

## Phase 4: Evaluation Criteria
This is critical. Help me define how we'll measure success:
- **Functional completeness:** What are the must-have behaviors?
- **Quality metrics:** Performance, test coverage, error rates?
- **Data completeness:** If data is involved, how do we verify it's complete/accurate?
- **User validation:** How will we know users are satisfied?

Create a scoring rubric:
| Criteria | Weight | How to Measure | Target |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------|

## Phase 5: Implementation Breakdown
Once scope and evaluation are solid:
- Break into phases (what can we ship incrementally?)
- Within phases, identify tasks
- Flag tasks that need spikes/research first
- Estimate rough effort (S/M/L)

## Phase 6: Generate Epic Doc
Only after I confirm alignment, create /docs/epics/epic-[slug].md with:
```markdown
